## Introduction

The `_printf` function in C is a fundamental utility that allows developers to display messages and data in a structured and customizable manner. This project aims to deepen our understanding of low-level programming concepts, enhance our problem-solving skills, and provide a reliable and efficient implementation of this essential function.

## Features

- Support for various format specifiers, including character strings, integers, floating-point numbers, and more.
- Compatibility with standard flags and modifiers, allowing for customizable output.
- Modular design for easy extensibility and maintainability.
- Thoroughly tested codebase to ensure correctness and reliability.
- Detailed documentation to aid in understanding and contributing to the project.

## Usage

To use our custom `_printf` function in your C project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kroser_draid/_printf.git
```
2. Include the main.h header file in your C source code:

#include "main.h"
```
3. Call the _printf function as you would with the standard library function:

int main() {
    _printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
4. Compile your code, linking with the _printf object file:

gcc -o your_program your_program.c _printf.o
```
5. Run your program:

./your_program
```
